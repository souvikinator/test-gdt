# How to run it?
The **larger one is paddle** and the **smaller one is ball**.

1. **First run:**
   1.1  inside `Board.gd` set `is_playing = true` and run the game
   1.2  then you can drag the larger one using mouse and hit the ball.
   
2. **Second run (replicating the first run):**
   2.1 inside the `Board.gd` set `is_playing = false` and run the game it
   2.2 It'll automatically start consuming logs/data from the **First run** and will try to replay the motion in first game play
